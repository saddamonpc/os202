6. [Virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6)<br>

8. [User and Operating-System Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8)<br>

That's where several types of interfaces, like Command Interpreters, Graphical User Interface (GUI), and Touch-Screen Interface comes to the rescue. Most operating systems, such as Linu and Windows, treat the command interpreter as a special program that is running when a process started. General users, usually use the graphical user interface and touch-screen interface, as it is more intuitive and easy to learn.

10. [Vim (text editor)](https://www.vim.org/about.php)<br>
Vim is a standalone, configurable, advanced text editor that seeks to be efficient for their users. Through my journey in computer science, I've always used Notepad++ as my text editor. Although, Vim is a more appropriate alternative for a computer scientist text editor, as they don't require you to switch between tabs and are highly technical.
