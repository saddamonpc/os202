# Top 10 List of Week 02

### Why hello there! I'm thankful you have the time to read my top 10 of week 2 of this course. This week topic is **Security and Protection.** Please do realize that this top 10 are my opinion and may not be the same with yours. 
The way I grade this top 10 list are by 3 categories:
* how important it is,
* how simple it is,
* and how relevant the topic is to the operating system course.
Please enjoy your stay here, and good luck to my other mates doing this course!

NOTE for Instructor: I apologize for not working on the assignment at thursday morning. Through my exprience on working this course's assignments, 1 hour and 40 minutes is not enough to be done with it. That's why I reserved Friday or Saturday to work on the assigments. Once again, I'm sorry.

5. Protection: Security Measures <br>
Extended from point number 9 in my week 0 top 10 list, Absolute protection of the system from malicious attacks is not possible, but the cost to the perpetrator can be made sufficiently high to intimidate and deter most intruders. To protect a system, it is essential to take security measures at **four** levels:
1. Physical <br> The sites containing the computer systems must be physically secured against entry by intruders. For example, by limiting access to the building they reside in, or locking them to the desk on which they sit.
2. Network <br> Most computer systems are networked. Networking provides a mean for the system to access external resources but also provides a potential entry for unauthorized access to the system itself. Preventing interception of the data through the network is one of the solution to prevent these kind of attacks.
3. Operating System <br> The operating system and its built-in set of applications and services comprise a huge code base that may harbor many vulnerabilities. Thus, operating systems must be kept up to date and "hardened" via continuous patching.
4. Application <br> Third-party applications may also pose risks, especially if they bear admin privileges. Some applications are made to be malicious, but even some applications may contain security bugs. It is virtually impossible to ensure that all such applications are secure, but preventive measures such as making sure the application are made from a trustworthy and reputable company reduces the risk tremendously.

6. Program Threats <br>
Processes, and kernel are the only means of accomplishing work on a computer. Therefore, writing a program creates a breach of security, and attackers may manipulate programs such that it can cause a breach to a system without authorization. The list below are some threats that attackers have made in before:
- Malware <br> Malware is a software designed to exploit, disable, or damage computer systems. There are many ways to perform such activities. A variation of malwares are spyware (capture user's information) and ransomware (encrypts victim's data and asks the victim to pay to get the data back). 
- Code Injection <br> Code injection is the event in which executable code is added or modified, such that the attacker are able to take over the program code, subverting its existing code flow, or entirely reprogramming it by supplying new code.
- Viruses and Worm <br> A virus and worm is a fragment of code embedded in a legitimate program. Viruses are self-replicating and are deisgned to "infect" other programs. They can wreak havoc in a system by modifying or destroying files and causing system crashes and program malfunctions. The only difference between a virus and a worm is that, the former requires human interaction, while the latter uses a network to replicate without any help from humans.
