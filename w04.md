# Top 10 List of Week 04

### Why hello there! I'm thankful you have the time to read my top 10 of week 4 of this course. This week topic is **Addressing, Shared Lib, and Pointer.** Please do realize that this top 10 are my opinion and may not be the same with yours. 
### The way I grade this top 10 list are by 3 categories:
### * how important it is,
### * how simple it is,
### * and how relevant the topic is to the operating system course.
#### I heard this week is gonna be tough, and it shows. This week's topic houses one of the most complicated operating system concepts. While I do wish that my journey in computer science is going to be easier, well... It doesn't, and I don't think it will ever be. But, hardwork pays off, and at least I'll probably get a job out of it. 
### Please enjoy your stay here, and good luck to my other mates doing this course!
